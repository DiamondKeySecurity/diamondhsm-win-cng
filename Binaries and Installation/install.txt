Installation instructions:
- Copy the target DLL ("diamond-hsm-cng-ksp_Win32.dll" or "diamond-hsm-cng-ksp_x64") files to the "%System Root%\System32" folder. In most installations, 
this will be the "C:\Windows\System32" folder.

- From the command prompt run the configuration program ("diamond-hsm_ksp_config_Win32.exe" or "diamond-hsm_ksp_config_x64.exe") to register the 
DLL with windows. The command prompt will need to be opened using administrator privileges.

- After the HSM has been registered with the operating system, the IP address of the PKCS #11 user PIN must be set using the configuration program,
"diamondhsm_ksp_config_Win32.exe" or "diamond-hsm_ksp_config_x64.exe". This information will be saved in the registry under the current user.

        diamond-hsm_ksp_config_x64.exe -pin <user pin/password>
        diamond-hsm_ksp_config_x64.exe -ipaddress <ip address of the HSM>

- The "certutil -csplist" command can be used from the command prompt to verify installation.
